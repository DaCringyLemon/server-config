# server-config
The ultimate repository for optimised server configuration files, and I will be updating this!

I have made many, many servers in the past, and I found that one of the _most frustrating_ parts of setting it up is editing the config files. So, I have taken the time and effort of configuring all of the server files so they are optimised for lag removal. All downloads will be in the repository, so you don't have to type ANYTHING yourself. This will also eventually include extra files, such as plugin configs, and start.sh or start.bat files.
